Since 1978, O'Reilly has been a chronicler and catalyst of leading-edge development, homing in on the technology trends that really matter and galvanizing their adoption by amplifying "faint signals" from the alpha geeks who are creating the future.

          <p>Sourcegraph is a code search engine that shows you documentation and real-world usage examples for hundreds of thousands of libraries written in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Go. Unlike other code search engines and Google, Sourcegraph analyzes source code. It automatically identifies functions, classes, etc., in code and finds all references to them (even from other repositories), which means you can quickly find accurate and comprehensive docs and examples.</p>
