                        Gabriel has been a programmer for 20 years, having used several languages, starting from Basic, Pascal, C and some C++, transitioning to (a lot) of JavaScript (among others such as PHP, SQL, and many more), and nowadays Go.
						<br /><br />
						He currently works at Thomson Reuters where he does JavaScript in London, and Go in his free time. He has spent time working with different companies on Go projects, both open-source and private, one of those that is worth mentioning would be Sourcegraph, with whom he has spent time in San Francisco working on their (awesome!) web application, where they have learnt a lot from each other!
