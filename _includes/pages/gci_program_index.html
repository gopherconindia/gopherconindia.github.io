          <p><strong>Talk: Go Stdlib and Data Science</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">A common misconception among data scientists is that the Go ecosystem lacks the proper tooling to enable data science in Go. In this talk, we will shatter that misconception by showing how the stdlib itself can power robust and productive data science development. The Go data science ecosystem is exploding with great tooling for data science and data engineering, and there are many gophers utilizing Go to develop robust, efficient, and valuable data-driven applications. However, many in the data science community maintain that Go lacks proper tooling to be productive as a data scientist. In this session, we will shatter that misconception by showing that Go itself (i.e., the stdlib) can enable productive data science development. We will tackle an example data science project, highlighting how the stdlib can be used to accomplish common data science tasks.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Fighting latency - the CPU profiler is not your ally</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">CPU profiling sure is nice for crypto attacks and batch processing, but many times our systems are not CPU-bound, and the king of our era is latency, not processing bandwidth. Cloudflare machines are never at 100% CPU, but it doesn’t mean we can’t make our systems faster. So the goal of this talk is dual: “raising awareness” on how our go-to CPU profiling is not necessarily the right way to approach latency issues, and showcasing a great tool built right into the Go runtime that’s way too little known. The Cloudflare DNS server surely benefited, hopefully attendees will, too!</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Open Source Project Flogo for Lightweight Microservices and as Integration Gateway for the Internet of Things</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">The Internet of Things (IoT) brings up 50 billion devices until 2020, which have to be connected somehow. Challenges include low bandwidth, high latency, non-reliable connectivity and the need for low network costs. Therefore, a gateway is needed remotely on site of the devices to filter, aggregate and send just relevant data into the cloud or data center. This session introduces project Flogo: A 100% open source framework, which allows developing ultra lightweight IoT integration applications with a zero-coding web user interface or design chat bot. Coders can also rely just on code, of course. It is written in Google’s Go programming language and 20-50x more lightweight than similar Java or JavaScript frameworks. Therefore building very lightweight microservices independent of IoT is another good use case for this framework, e.g. for serverless architectures using open source frameworks such as OpenWhisk. The session focuses on live demos and shows how to build microservices and integrate IoT devices using standards such as MQTT, WebSockets, CoaP or REST. The last part of the session compares Project Flogo to other open source IoT projects like Node-RED and SaaS offerings such as AWS IoT.</p>

          <p class="about-speaker">Isomorphic Go code, is Go code, that can run on both the client-side and on the server-side. GopherJS gives us the ability to unleash the power of Go in the web browser, and it opens up the capability to utilize Go as a solution for full-stack development. I will present the compelling reasons to use Go on the front-end. I will demonstrate how we can use GopherJS to display a 3D scene in the web browser. We will examine how GopherJS makes it possible to port a command line web socket client to the web browser. I will demonstrate how to use Go's template package to generate output directly within the web browser. Finally, I will demonstrate how we can transmit data from client to server using gob encoding over XHR.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Building High Performance APIs In Go Using gRPC And Protocol Buffers</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">This session will demonstrate how to build high-performance, massively-scalable APIs in Go using Google’s gRPC and Protocol Buffers. The session will introduce how to use gRPC as a communication protocol for Microservices architecture. By using gRPC with Protocol Buffers, you can build high performance APIs, which can provide high performance and scalability power than JSON based RESTful APIs. gRPC is a high performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework from Google, which can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems. By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format. Protocol Buffers, also referred as protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Protocol Buffers are smaller, faster, and simpler that provides high performance than other standards such as XML and JSON. systems by implementing various messaging patterns. gRPC is built with mobile clients in mind that will give you lot of performance advantages and easiness for consuming APIs.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Fast and Scalable Machine Learning with GoLang</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">Go is now used in various domains, across various platforms as a general purpose programming language. With Go Lang’s fast compiler, built-in concurrency features high-performance, large-scale scientific and technical computing is the next step. In this talk various machine learning techniques using Go Lang are talked about and several practical case studies are discussed. Go is gaining traction as a language to be used like R, Matlab and Python for solving solving complex machine learning problems. This talk is based particularly on various implementations of machine learning algorithms in Go and developing fast applications using various libraries for linear algebra, probability distribution functions, decision trees, bayesian classifiers, neural networks and recommender systems. Comparison of Go with other languages for developing data science applications, architecture and implementations of several practical solutions will be discussed in the talk.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Package Oriented Design</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">You have learned the language and now you are ready to start building your product. Sounds easy but where do you begin? Go is not like other languages in the sense that you can’t organize your source code using folders. If you do, you are going to have problems. This is because each folder in your source tree represents a package. A self contained unit of compiled code. The better job you do in identifying the unique packages you need to solve the problem, the easier your projects will be to manage, support and grow over time. Developer productivity on the project will directly relate to how well you design your packages and their API. This has been my experience and this is what I will share with you in this talk. My best practices and guidelines to package oriented design.</p>
